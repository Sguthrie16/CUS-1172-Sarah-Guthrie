    <hr>
    <div class="row">
        <div id="basic_info" class="column_intro" style="padding-top:40px;">
            <p>My name is Sarah Guthrie and I am a current <span class="important_info">
            senior </span>at St. John's University. I am majoring in <span class="important_info">
              computer science with a concentration in Cyber Security.</span>
                I have always enjoyed the front end aspect of coding as opposed to back end,
                because it allows me to demonstrate my creative side. This semester rather
                than taking technical classes I am enrolled in a few classes the
                challenge my creativity. In addition to this class I am taking a
                jewelery making class. These two classes allow me to challenge my creative side.
                In addition to the creative aspect of this class I am interested in bettering
                my coding languages. Last semester I was able to learn python in CUS 1166 with
                professor Christoforo and hope that I can grow on that.  </span> </p>

    <h5 style="color:#3d1b5b;"><em>Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with a concentration in Cyber Security </em></h5>
    <p>Throughout my four years at St. John's I have taken classes ranging in many different subjects.
        Through my major I have taken classes covering many topics within computer science.
        I have taken recently software engineering, computer architecture, and database.
        Though these classes have been enjoyable I have preferred my cyber security classes.
        The ones I find most interesting is digital forensics. During my internship this
        summer I was able to help out with a case and see how digital forensics is used in the workspace.
        Once I start working full time I hope to dig more into this as well as cyber assessment.
        Within my cyber security classesI have acquired a Mobilyzer certificate given by Blackhat
        and as working on getting my CelleBrite certificate.</p>
