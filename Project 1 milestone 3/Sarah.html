          <p>My name is Sarah Guthrie and I am a current <span class="basic_info">
            senior </span>at St. John's University. I am majoring in <span class="basic_info">
              computer science with a concntration in cyber security.</span>
              I have always enjoyed the front end aspect of coding as opposed to back end,
              because it allows me to demonstrate my creative side. This semester rather
              than taking technical classes I am enrolled in a few classes the
              challenge my creativity. In addition to this class I am taking a
              jewlery making class. These two classes allow me to challenge my creative side.
              In addition to the creative aspect of this class I am interested in bettering
              my coding languages. Last semeester I was able to learn python in CUS 1166 with
              professor Christoforo and hope that I can grow on that.  </span> </p>

    <h5 >Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with a concentration in Cyber Security </h5>
    <p>Throughout my four years at St. John's I have taken classes ranging in many different subjects.
      Through my major I have taken classes covering many topics within computer sciecne.
      I have taken recently software enginering, computer archietecture, and database.
      Though these classes have been enjoyable I have prefered my cyber security classes.
      The ones I find most interesting is digital forensics. During my internship this
      summer I was able to help out with a case and see how digital forensics is used in the workspace.
      Once I start working full time I hope to dig more into this as well as cyber assessment.
      Within my cyber security classesI have acquired a Mobilyzer certificate given by Blackhat
      and as wokring on getting my CelleBrite certificate.</p>
